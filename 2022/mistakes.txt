Day 1:
- Forgetting that i renamed groups to inp_groups
- Sorting in the wrong order

Day 2:
- Getting the permutations of the results table wrong several times, leading to 4 wrong submissions
- Misreading the question on which results XYZ mean

Day 3:
- None!

Day 4:
- None!

Day 5:
- Having my groups utility call strip on each group
- Several off-by-ones: creating one too few crates, appending to the wrong crate
- P2: Mixing up the new vs moved crates

Day 6:
- Reading to carefully, thinking part 2 was a little more complex than it was

Day 7:
- Needing to look up dataclasses.field
- Forgetting to count files in my everything_under method
- Missing the last command, causing the example to still pass (ws)
- Missing that I need to free up a certain amount of space rather than just delete a dir over 30000000

Day 8:
- Not checking both `p0 in inp and p0+d in inp`
- Comparing to d rather than p 
- Then comparing adjacent trees rather than to the main tree (`inp[p0+d] >= inp[p0]` rather than `inp[p0+d] >= inp[p]`) 
-- (3s off p1 leaderboard)
- Mistyping [] rather than p

Day 9:
- Waking up late
- Counting the tail's position after completing a full line rather than an individual step

Day 10:
- Copy/pasting the list of expected cycle numbers and missing the 220
- Off by one: outputting on the wrong cycle 
- Not running part 2 up to 240 cycles, and trying to guess what the obscured letters were (ws)
- Mistakes in rendering, leaving it still readable (newline too early in first row, first column is moved to last)
- 2 mistakes that canceled out: when rewriting runner for part 2, I checking x after rather than during the cycle, 
  but also considering the pixels to be in the range 1-40 rather than 0-39; so it was effectively checking where x is next cycle. 
  Net effect was only to chop off the first column, leaving the result still readable.
