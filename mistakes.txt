Day 1:
- Not using an IDE
- `import utils` instead of `from utils import *`

Day2:
- Bug in submit script: level should be part, not day (didn't catch it since I only tested on 2018 part 1 day 1)

Day3:
- Not expecting there to be a trailing newline on each line; messing up my `% len(line)` calculation
- Transposing my x and y coords for the slopes in part 2

Day 4:
- Incorrectly truncating the last record
- Forgetting to actually return something from a function
- Mistyping 260 as 280 in the submission field
- Putting [:-2] in the wrong place when validating inches
- Not making my strings with \ in them raw (thanks vscode)
- Not wrapping my regexes with ^ and $ [edit: or using re.fullmatch]

Day 5:
- Trying to fiddle around with my submit function cost me a lot more time than just copying it to my browser would
