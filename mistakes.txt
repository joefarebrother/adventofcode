Day 1:
- Not using an IDE
- `import utils` instead of `from utils import *`

Day2:
- Bug in submit script: level should be part, not day (didn't catch it since I only tested on 2018 part 1 day 1)

Day3:
- Not expecting there to be a trailing newline on each line; messing uo my "% len(grid)" calculation
- Transposing my x and y coords for the slopes in part 2
