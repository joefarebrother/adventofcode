Day 1:
- being rusty and taking a while to get started from looking at problem 
- t instead of l

Day 2:
- Not returning True
- Not reversing list [::1] instead of [::-1]

Day 3:
- Examplefinder failed (check for characters in ex not in inp spuriously rejects example (_ not in inp))
- & instead f * (ws)
- Autotest bug prints wrong remaining time for ws penalty

Day 4:
- Clicking on discord causing it to open and inturrupe me
- Considering only 1 direction 
- when considering more directions putting the loop in the wrong place causing it to track an extra long word
- returning True instead of count

Day 5:
- Attempting to use topsort (real input is cyclic)
- Attempting to use rechability (real input is cyclic)
- Not restarting pc since memory was fine and for some reason = key is unreliable except after restart 
- Wrong indexing for middle
- Autotest bug not using variable i
- Aversion to O(n^2) when n is small 
- Using `cmp_to_key` wrong (though wouldn't have worked on real anyway)

Day 6:
- Several typos of wrong vars (g and p instead of d, 1 instead of d)
- Overiting walls with dots
- List instead of set causing doublecounting
- Autotest bug not having sumarized_real set
- Searching whole grid rather than path

Day 7:
- mixed up variables eq and inp a few times

Day 8:
- Allowing antinodes outside the grid 
- Thinking there were exactly 2 of each freq
- Missing that in p2 the nodes themselves get included

Day 9:
- way overcomplcating p1, making many mistakes in the process
- handling an unneeded case in p2 where a file could be moved into a smaller space immedietely to its left but this is not what the problem asks for (bc i handled that with the way i did p1)
- adding unnecassary 0-size free blocks making p2 a lot slower

Day 10:
- mixing up the variables g and gr 
- writing 0 instead of 9
