Day 1:
- Not testing my new input function
- Off by one: finding sliding windows using range(len(in)-3) misses final window (ws)

Day 2:
- += instead of -= (ws)
- misinterpreting instructions (affecting depth in the up/down commands as well as aim) (ws)

Day 3:
- Calculating the most common thing twice instead of most and least common (ws)

Day 4: 
- Getting no sleeo
- Spending a long time fiddling about with parsing the input (including thinking the boards were commna seoarated rather than space separated)
- == insstead of =
