Day 1:
- i got 99 problems so i used regular expressions and now i got 100 problems (re.findall not considering overlaps - ws)
Day 2:
- misreading (not realising there were ;, thought it was the sum)
Day 3:
- missing diagonal adjacents
Day 4:
- None
Day 5:
- map instead of mapl in parsing (so iterating again doesn't work)
- wrong arithmetic (forgot to subtract src_start)
Day 6:
- not just trying the p1 solution again 
Day 7:
- typo in rank checker (ws)
- spending a while trying to make a more complex checker involving jokers 
- not actually printing the p2 output
Day 8:
- spending a very long time trying to compute an impossible CRT due to using the wrong step values (time to first thing that repeats instead of time to first z)
