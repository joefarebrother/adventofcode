Day 1:
- i got 99 problems so i used regular expressions and now i got 100 problems (re.findall not considering overlaps - ws)
Day 2:
- misreading (not realising there were ;, thought it was the sum)
Day 3:
- missing diagonal adjacents
Day 4:
- None
Day 5:
- map instead of mapl in parsing (so iterating again doesn't work)
- wrong arithmetic (forgot to subtract src_start)
Day 6:
- not just trying the p1 solution again 
Day 7:
- typo in rank checker (ws)
- spending a while trying to make a more complex checker involving jokers 
- not actually printing the p2 output
Day 8:
- spending a very long time trying to compute an impossible CRT due to using the wrong step values (time to first thing that repeats instead of time to first z)
Day 9:
- None major; just spent a little longer than needed changing everything necessary for p2
Day 10:
- floodfill on whole integer coords doesn't work
- start point for finding area was pipe 
- accidental quadratic trying to visualise
Day 11:
- not subtracting 1
Day 12:
- missing that copies are separated by ?
Day 13:
- few off by one errors
Day 14:
- not changing < to >
- going over the target (not subtracting i from target when calculating reps)
Day 15:
- calculating hash wrong (multiplying by 17 first)
- spending a while before realising that what it's asking is actually very simple
Day 16:
- None
Day 17:
- p1 missing "can't reverse" (ws), p2 ob1e c<10 instead of c<9 (ws)
Day 18:
- Not implementing the shoelace formula + pick's theorem approach to Day 10 to have ready for today
Day 19:
- Not implementing general cuboid set class earlier 
- Implementing general cuboid set handling now when all sets that can end up in the same workflow are already disjoint
- Mutability issue; not copying dims list on splitting
