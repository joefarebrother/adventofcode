Day 1:
- Not using an IDE
- `import utils` instead of `from utils import *`

Day2:
- Bug in submit script: level should be part, not day (didn't catch it since I only tested on 2018 part 1 day 1)

Day3:
- Not expecting there to be a trailing newline on each line; messing up my `% len(line)` calculation
- Transposing my x and y coords for the slopes in part 2

Day 4:
- Incorrectly truncating the last record
- Forgetting to actually return something from a function
- Mistyping 260 as 280 in the submission field
- Putting [:-2] in the wrong place when validating inches
- Not making my strings with \ in them raw (thanks vscode)
- Not wrapping my regexes with ^ and $ [edit: or using re.fullmatch]

Day 5:
- Trying to fiddle around with my submit function cost me a lot more time than just copying it to my browser would

Day 6:
- Coutning the set of words rather than the set of letters (wrong submission)
- Traling newline in final group messing up count for part 2 (interpreted as an extra person answering no questions) (ws)

Day 7:
- Skipped the start time due to not being able to get enough sleep
- Something didn't work at first (producing 0) and I don't know what I changed that made it work again (edit: I believe I missed a return statement making a function always return none)
- Included the shily gold bag in the result (wrong submission - off by one)
- Thought that I had misunderstood the question and it wanted unqualified colours (e.g. just 'orange') instead of things like 'dim orange' but I in fact had it right the first time (ws)
- Included my own bag in the total count of bags again, leading to off-by-one (ws)

Day 8:
- None!!!
