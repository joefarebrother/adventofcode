Day 1:
- being rusty and taking a while to get started from looking at problem 
- t instead of l

Day 2:
- Not returning True
- Not reversing list [::1] instead of [::-1]

Day 3:
- Examplefinder failed (check for characters in ex not in inp spuriously rejects example (_ not in inp))
- & instead f * (ws)
- Autotest bug prints wrong remaining time for ws penalty

Day 4:
- Clicking on discord causing it to open and inturrupe me
- Considering only 1 direction 
- when considering more directions putting the loop in the wrong place causing it to track an extra long word
- returning True instead of count

Day 5:
- Attempting to use topsort (real input is cyclic)
- Attempting to use rechability (real input is cyclic)
- Not restarting pc since memory was fine and for some reason = key is unreliable except after restart 
- Wrong indexing for middle
- Autotest bug not using variable i
- Aversion to O(n^2) when n is small 
- Using `cmp_to_key` wrong (though wouldn't have worked on real anyway)
