Day 1:
- Not testing my new input function
- Off by one: finding sliding windows using range(len(in)-3) misses final window (ws)

Day 2:
- += instead of -= (ws)
- misinterpreting instructions (affecting depth in the up/down commands as well as aim) (ws)

Day 3:
- Calculating the most common thing twice instead of most and least common (ws)

Day 4: 
- Getting no sleep
- Spending a long time fiddling about with parsing the input (including thinking the boards were commna seoarated rather than space separated)
- == instead of =

Day 5:
- Wasting time trying to write a regex for the input rather than using my ints_in utility
- `x[0] == x[3] or x[1] == x[2]` doesn't select the lines lol 
- Getting the sign wrong for ranges, leading to them being empty
- Incrementing y before incrementing the grid cell ratehr than after (ws)
- Re-running incorrect jupyter cells that had modified state (ws part 2, slow down part 1)
