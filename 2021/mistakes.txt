Day 1:
- Not testing my new input function
- Off by one: finding sliding windows using range(len(in)-3) misses final window (ws)

Day 2:
- += instead of -= (ws)
- misinterpreting instructions (affecting depth in the up/down commands as well as aim) (ws)

Day 3:
- Calculating the most common thing twice instead of most and least common (ws)

Day 4: 
- Getting no sleep
- Spending a long time fiddling about with parsing the input (including thinking the boards were commna seoarated rather than space separated)
- == instead of =

Day 5:
- Wasting time trying to write a regex for the input rather than using my ints_in utility
- `x[0] == x[3] or x[1] == x[2]` doesn't select the lines lol 
- Getting the sign wrong for ranges, leading to them being empty
- Incrementing y before incrementing the grid cell ratehr than after (ws)
- Re-running incorrect jupyter cells that had modified state (ws part 2, slow down part 1)

Day 6:
- None!

Day 7:
- Changing the wrong instance of `inp` to `range(min(inp), max(inp))`
- autotest bug: not using python3.9

Day 8
- Getting no sleep
- autotest bug: doesn't download input file if it exists but is empty
- Taking a long time understanding what the question is saying
- Trying to figure out something clever for part 2 before realising brute force should work
- Not sorting my permuted patterns before checking they were in segs

Day 9:
- Bug in grid.py: defines redundant version of readlines that was not kept up to date
